# Guide for contributors

> Thank you for your interest in Emendare!
> The platform needs your contributions to improve.

You can contribute in several ways:

- By reporting errors and bugs of the platform and / or by proposing corrections in the [Issues](https://github.com/jimmyleray/Emendare/issues)
- By participating in the development and resolution of a [Board ticket](https://github.com/jimmyleray/Emendare/projects)
- By participating in discussions on the [slack Zenika](https://zenika.slack.com/messages/CD1BQ03A9/) (soon a dedicated slack)
- By participating in the Roadmap text on the platform
- And of course, talking about Emendare around you

You can also help us to enrich this page to improve the contributors' experience.
