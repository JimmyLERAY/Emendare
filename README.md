## Tech / framework used

The current stack of this project is :

- Frontend side :

  - [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) as a framework for the client interface
  - [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/) as a css framework based on Flexbox

- Backend side :
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the API server and the application server
  - [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) for the client / server exchanges
  - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/en) as database

## Getting started

These instructions make it possible to create a copy of the project and to be able to execute it locally, for the development but also in production.

### Prerequisites

To set up the project installation, you must have **Node.js** installed.
To install Node.js, please refer to the [Node.js official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installation

The installation of the project requires 2 steps: a configuration of the server and another of the client.

#### Server configuration

The first step will be to create the MongoDB database. To do so just create a container containing a Mongo image, following the steps below.

```bash
cd server/
```

then creating the Mongo image :

```bash
docker-compose build
```

> This 'build' command is only to be done during installation.

and to finish throwing the container :

```bash
docker-compose start
```

The database is accessible at the following address: **localhost: 27017 / emendare**.

Once the database is in place we will be able to install the dependencies :

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the server either for production :

```bash
npm build
npm start
```

Either for development with these two tasks in parallel :

```bash
npm run build:watch
npm run dev
```

These commands are used to launch the server at the following address : **localhost:3030**

#### Client configuration

For the client installation the first step will be to install the dependencies.

```bash
cd client/
npm install
```

To launch the client, two solutions will be possible :

- in development :

```bash
npm run dev
```

- in production :

```bash
npm build
npm start
```

The app.js server will allow http redirection to https as well as Gzip compression of the application files.
